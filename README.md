I'll create a README.md file for the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project.

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis classifier for tweets using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of tweets using clustering and text processing approaches.

## Dataset
- Source: Twitter API extracted dataset
- Features:
  - Target: Tweet polarity (0 = negative, 1 = positive)
  - Text: Tweet content
- Files:
  - `train1.csv`: Training dataset
  - `test1.csv`: Test dataset
  - `sample.csv`: Sample submission file

## Methodology
- Text Preprocessing:
  - Cleaning: Remove non-alphabetic characters
  - Lowercasing
  - Stopwords removal (except 'not')
  - Porter Stemming

- Feature Extraction:
  - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)
  - Maximum features: 9000

- Classification:
  - Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian)

## Evaluation Metric
- Mean F1-Score
  - Combines precision and recall
  - Calculated as: F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies
2. Download dataset files
3. Run the Python script
4. Generated predictions will be saved as CSV

## Competition Details
- Start Date: July 1, 2024
- End Date: July 12, 2024

The README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its methodology, and key details. Would you like me to modify anything?
